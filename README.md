Internet Draft describing how to apply the Synthetic IV (SIV)
block cipher mode of operation to non-AES block ciphers. In particular
where the block size and/or MAC tag size are not 128-bits, and where
they might differ from each other.

Also includes example code for a XChaCha20-HMAC-SHA256-SIV mode.
